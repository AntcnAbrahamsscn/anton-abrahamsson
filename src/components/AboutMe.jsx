                    My name is Anton Abrahamsson and I'm a 28 years old Front-end
                    student who loves snowboarding and watching bushcraft videos
                    on YouTube. Two years ago, I completed my Bachelor's degree
                    in Media and Communication with a specialization in Visual
                    Communication and Design at Karlstad University. Since
                    graduation, I have been working as a print editor at GÃ¶teborgs-Posten and Nya Wermlands-Tidningen
                   .

                    In addition, last fall I started my journey into Front-end
                    studies, motivated by my interest in web development and
                    programming. My goal is to merge the skills I acquire in
                    frontend development with my background in media, forming an
                    expertise that I am eager to contribute to my future
                    workplace. Currently, I am searching for a workplace to
                    have my second internship for the period of 2025-03-17 - 2025-06-06.
