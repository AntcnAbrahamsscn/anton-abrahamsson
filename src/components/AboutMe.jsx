                    My name is Anton Abrahamsson. I'm a 28 year old Front End
                    student who loves snowboarding and watching bushcraft videos
                    on YouTube. Two years ago, I completed my Bachelor's degree
                    in Media and Communication with a specialization in Visual
                    Communication and Design at Karlstad University. Since
                    graduation, I have been working as a print editor at NWT
                    Media and GP, via Media Resurs.

                    In addition, this fall I started my journey into Front End
                    studies, motivated by my interest in web development and
                    programming. My goal is to merge the skills I acquire in
                    Front End development with my background in media, forming a
                    expertise that I am eager to contribute to my future
                    workplace. Currently, I am searching for an workplace to
                    have my LIA (Lärande i Arbete) for the periods of:
                    2024-11-11 - 2025-01-31 and 2025-03-17 - 2025-06-06.
